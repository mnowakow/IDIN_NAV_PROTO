<!-- # pdf_viewer2

A low level Score Viewer App supporting the following functionalities: multiple accounts, pdf viewing and scrolling, drawing, access to pre-existing musical symbols, views of other accounts' annotations, and resizing, deleting (limited to the current account's annotations), and copying annotations.

## User Guide

In VSCode, connect an iOS Simulator (iPad Air 13-inch (M2))--Android is NOT supported--turn the screen to landscape mode, navigate to main.dart and then select "Start Debugging". In the simulator, a login screen should pop up, enter a username and click login. 

## Considerations for Future Improvement

* Custom SVGs in the musical symbols menu do not always appear in their slot, this is due to SVG viewbox and translation issues (which is handled in myHomePage.dart line 447)
* There is no logout function...In order to logout, the user must first end the debugger in VSCode and then start the program again.
